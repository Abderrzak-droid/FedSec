Things to add to our PFE's literature review


** A membership inference attack allows an adversary
to query a trained machine learning model to predict whether or
not a particular example was contained in the modelâ€™s training
dataset.

**Differential privacy  //

** Depth in Taxonomy and Classification
Expand Attack Categories: Include emerging attack types (e.g., membership inference, model inversion) and hybrid attacks (e.g., combined poisoning and evasion).

**Defense Sub-Categorization: Classify defenses by proactive (e.g., adversarial training) vs. reactive (e.g., anomaly detection) approaches, or centralized vs. decentralized mechanisms.

**Add a comparison matrix for defenses, evaluating:

		--Computational overhead.

		--Scalability in large-scale FL.

		--Compatibility with non-IID data.

		--Resistance to colluding attackers.

**Reference incidents such as the 2023 MITRE APT41 report on FL vulnerabilities.

**honest-but-curious

**cross-silo vs cross-device

**gradient inversion attack 

**Add diagrams to illustrate:

		--Attack lifecycles (e.g., APT stages in FL).

		--Defense architectures (e.g., layered security for aggregation server
